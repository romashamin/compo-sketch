**Compo 1.5 supports Sketch 45 plugin updating system**

Compo is a Sketch plugin that makes it easier to work with interface components. With Compo, pressing ⌘J is all it takes to turn a text layer into a button or put an existing component in order. The plugin is especially effective if used jointly with [State Machine](https://github.com/romashamin/statemachine-sketch).
